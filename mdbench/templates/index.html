<h1>Molecular Dynamics Benchmarks</h1>
<p>Benchmarking is essential for finding the optimal job simulation and submission parameters. New users might be unaware of the hardware- and software-specific details required to run efficient simulations on Compute Canada HPC clusters.  A poor choice of parameters can increase the simulation speed only by a narrow margin or even degrade it leading to a waste of computing resources. Therefore, it is in the interest of every user to optimize their usage of hardware resources and, at the same time, keep their simulation time to a minimum. </p>
